[Upskill](http://upskillcourses.com) Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App



A project of mine following Upskills web development course that focuses on ruby on rails. 
The website is a webapp where developers can match with each other to collaborate; somewhat like a linkedin for devs. 
Throughout the course MVC is explained thouroughly and it emphasizes understanding documentation. 
The course starts with creating web pages using boostrap and ROR best practices, focusing on design and basic functionality. 
It then moves onto creating forms and basic database structure and utilization using sqlite with ROR. 
This includes the functionality of sending emails to the web admin when someone fills out a contact us form. 
Moving on, the course focuses on user memberships and subscriptions where it focuses on using multiple services via gems such as Stripe services for secure credit card handling, 
Heroku for website deployment, and Figaro for rails app config. 
At this point in the course javascript and Jquery are heavily integrated into the subscription management functionality.
